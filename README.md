About linkedlist,arraylist and vector:

1)no syntax difference

Arraylist<>...=new...
Linkedlist<>...=new..
Vector<>..

2)all 3 uses add,set,get,remove function.

but vector uses addElemnt func,size is func of arraylist and capacity is func of vector.

3)arralist and vector works on basis of dynamic array, but arraylist increases size by 50%, but vector 100%..so memory is wasted.arrylist is not thread safe but faster..vector is threadsafe but slower.

Arrylst uses iteration interface for traversal,vecror uses iteration or enumaration interface.

So, arraylst is better than vector.

4)lnkdlist works on basis of doubly linkedlist..here insertion deletion is easy,but in arraylst is diffclt.but in case of access the scenario is reversed.

5)Arraylst not synchronised but vector sync.
